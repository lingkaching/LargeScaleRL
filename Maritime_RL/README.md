# Constrained Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for Large Agent Population
This repository includes three approaches: FICO (our proposed approach), LR_MACPO, and LR_MACPO+, which were tested for synthetic data in our ECML/PKDD 2022 paper. The code has been adapted from Dr. James Arambam's previous code. For more details, we refer you to his personal website: https://jamesarambam.github.io/.

## Running the code
```
cd FICO 
python launch.py
```
