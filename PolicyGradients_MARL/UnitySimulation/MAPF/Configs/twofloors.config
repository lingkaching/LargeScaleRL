## [Fixed Agent Spawning Specification]
## [Format(0-based) - AgentID, SpawnZoneID, GoalZoneID(s)]
## [Should be equal to number of agents - See the model file for that information. Also length of list should be either 1 or equal to agentsToSpawn defined earlier.]

## [Goals Per Agent Specification]
## [Format(0-based) - Number of goals per agent (single integer or a list per agent)]
## [Example - 1,2,3,1,2,4] OR [Example - 4]
## [Each value should be no more than the number of possible goal zones. Also length of list should be either 1 or equal to agentsToSpawn defined earlier.]
## [IMPORTANT: Assume possibleSpawnZones = 0,1,2 and possibleGoalZones = 0,3,4 -- Then agent spawning in zone 0 have only two options 3,4 for goal zones. Since 0 is common in both, make sure that you do ## not have more than 2 goals for any agent just to be safe in worst case. Therefore, ideally, Each value should be no more than the number of (possible goal zones - 1)].
